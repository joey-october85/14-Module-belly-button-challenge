==
The equality (==) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the strict equality operator, it attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different types.


  y: otuIDs.map(object => 'OTU ' + object),
map numbers to string, it confines them to the 10 sliced items

function optionChanged(id) {
  charts(id);
  metaDataInfo(id)
};

when a change is made to that tag. the function is called and the value is passed
